# html to image

I had the sudden need to send lots of md and html
to a service with a 2000 character limit (yes Discord).

So why not just send an image?
1. html -> image
2. md -> html -> image

One possible solution is to use [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) 
and its screenshot function but I can't run that on my server since it 
has low specs. Also I only want part of page because 
webscraping + extracting only part of the page's source.

So enter this. A super stripped html parser and renderer. 

**It's in a pretty good spot right now for what I need to I probably
won't be updating it much especially after implementing table things
and adding documentation. If you come across a problem, feel free
to make an issue or even a pr.**
