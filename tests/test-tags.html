<p>
    so right now if i see < at the start, i keep scanning until >
    and say that is a tag. But what if its not like that for example the following
</p>

<div>
    <you though this was a tag but its not really.
         Well intellij is indenting this line for some reason
         Is this just malformed html? i dont know because i dont really do html
         well we'll see what chrome says when i open this file
    </this looked like a closing tag but its not really. we'll see what happens
</div>

<div>
    < what about a space
    <div></div>
    > this looks fine
</div>

<customs>
    so i opened it up in chrome and the 2nd box doesnt show
    so looks good
    </ how about this intelliuj says this is bad too
    but then a random >pops up wait looks good how about a space > yep
</customs>
